  <h1>On derangements and the inclusion-exclusion principle</h1>
  <strong style="font-size: 24px; color: #940940">Question: Hector wrote down the first \(n\) positive integers in a
    random order, and so did Hessel.
    Both thus have a sequence of \(n\) integers. What is the probability that Hector and Hessel did not write the same
    number in the same position in the sequence anywhere?</strong>

  <br><br><br>
  <div style="color: purple"><strong>Partial answer:</strong> as \(n\) grows large, the probability approaches \(1/e\).
    (wtf?)</div>

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Solution:</strong>
  first, observe that this question is equivalent to asking,
  "what is the probability that in a sequence \(s_1,s_2,s_3,\dots,s_n\),
  containing the integers \(1\) up to and including \(n\) in random order,
  there is no \(i\in\set{1,2,3,\dots,n}\) such that \(s_i=i\)?"

  Actually, such a sequence is called a <em>derangement</em>. Let \(!n\) denote the number of derangements of length
  \(n\). Let \(\mathbb{P}(\texttt{der}_n)\) denote the probability that a sequence containing the numbers \(1\) up to
  and including \(n\) in random order is a derangement. Then the probability we want to compute, is
  \[\mathbb{P}(\texttt{der}_n)=\frac{!n}{n!}\]

  It becomes clear that we need to find a way to calculate \(!n\).

  <br><br><br>
  In order to do this, we use the <em>inclusion-exclusion principle</em>, which states that for all
  \(n\in\mathbb{N}_0\) for all finite sets \(A_1,A_2,\dots,A_n\) we have:
  \[\left|{\bigcup_{i=1}^nA_i}\right|=\sum_{\emptyset\neq J\subseteq\set{1,\dots,n}}(-1)^{|J|+1}\left|{\bigcap_{j\in
  J}A_j}\right|\]

  By the way, let's define an <em>\(n\)-sequence</em> to mean "a sequence \(s_1,s_2,\dots,s_n\) of length n containing
  the numbers
  \(1,2,\dots,n\)". Now, consider we have some \(n\) and wish to compute the number of \(n\)-sequences
  that are <em>not</em> a derangement. That is, we wish to compute \(n!\,-\,!n\).

  <br><br><br>
  Here comes the trick: let \(A_i\) be the set of \(n\)-sequences that have \(s_i=i\). Clearly, we then have
  \begin{align}
  n!\,-\,!n&=\left|{\bigcup_{i=1}^nA_i}\right|\nonumber\\[1.5em]
  &\quad\texttt{// by inclusion-exclusion principle}\nonumber\\
  &=\sum_{\emptyset\neq J\subseteq\set{1,\dots,n}}(-1)^{|J|+1}\left|{\bigcap_{j\in
  J}A_j}\right|\nonumber\\[1.7em]
  &\quad\texttt{// rewriting a bit}\nonumber\\
  &=\sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{\substack{\emptyset\neq J\subseteq\set{1,\dots,n}\\[0.25em]|J|=i}}(-1)^{i+1}\left|{\bigcap_{j\in
  J}A_j}\right|\nonumber\\[1.7em]
  \end{align}

  Observe now the following. \(\left|{\bigcap_{j\in J}A_j}\right|\) denotes the number of
  \(n\)-sequences which have, for all \(j\in J\), \(s_j=j\). If the cardinality of \(J\) is \(i\), then the cardinality
  of this intersection must be equal to \((n-i)!\), because we are effectively counting in how many ways we can arrange
  the \(n-i\) numbers that are not already "in a fixed position" in the \(n\)-sequence. Hence we find

  \[n!\,-\,!n=\sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{\substack{\emptyset\neq J\subseteq\set{1,\dots,n}\\[0.25em]|J|=i}}(-1)^{i+1}(n-i)!\]

  Now, observe that \((-1)^{i+1}(n-i)!\) is not dependent on \(J\) anymore, but only on the cardinality of \(J\).
  Knowing that for \(i\in\set{1,\dots,n}\) the number of subsets \(J\subseteq\set{1,2,\dots,n}\) of cardinality \(i\) is
  equal to \({n\choose i}=\frac{n!}{i!(n-i)!}\),
  we find that

  \begin{align}
  n!\,-\,!n&=\sum_{i=1}^n{n\choose i}(-1)^{i+1}(n-i)!\nonumber\\
  &=\sum_{i=1}^n(-1)^{i+1}\frac{n!}{i!}\nonumber
  \end{align}

  We're not going to get this even more simplified. So, let's go back to the original problem.
  The probabilty that we wanted to compute is
  \begin{align}
  \mathbb{P}(\texttt{der}_n)&=\frac{!n}{n!}\\
  &=\frac{n!-\sum_{i=1}^n(-1)^{i+1}\frac{n!}{i!}}{n!}\\
  &={1-\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{(-1)^{i+1}}{i!}}\\
  &=\boxed{\sum_{i=0}^n\frac{(-1)^{i}}{i!}}
  \end{align}

  That is the answer. The is one more curiosity: recall that the Taylor expansion of \(e^x\) is given by
  \[e^x=\sum_{i=0}^\infty\frac{x^i}{i!}\]

  We can use this to find an interesting result:

  \begin{align}
  \boxed{\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}\mathbb{P}(\texttt{der}_n)=e^{-1}}
  \end{align}

  By the way, apparently (i.e. according to <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derangement>Wikipedia</a>), this
  series converges so quickly that one can even say \[!n=\texttt{round}\left(\frac{n!}{e}\right) \quad\forall
  i\in\mathbb{N^+}\]
  where \(\texttt{round}(\cdot)\) denotes the nearest integer function.
  
  The proof of this is, uhm, obvious, and left as an exercise to the reader.
  This means that we can say
  \[\boxed{\mathbb{P}(\texttt{der}_n)=\frac{1}{n!}\,\texttt{round}\left(\frac{n!}{e}\right)\quad\forall
  i\in\mathbb{N^+}}\]
  as well.
