      <h1>Summary of double integrals in polar coordinates</h1>
      The polar coordinate system is a coordinate system to describe points \((r,\theta)\) in 2D using \(r\), the radial distance, and \(\theta\), the azimuthal angle.
      <br><image src="polar-crop.png" width=450/><br>
      Here, \(\theta\) is the angle measured from the \(x\)-axis to the \(y\)-axis, so anticlockwise. For example, the point \(P\) in the sketch is the point \((r,\theta)\) with \(r=1\) and \(\theta=\frac{\pi}{3}\).
      
      <br>
      Now, when solving integrals with polar coordinates, it is crucial to remember these identities:
      $$\boxed{x=r\cos\theta \qquad y=r\sin\theta}$$
      $$\boxed{x^2+y^2=r^2}$$

      And whereas we have \(dA=dx\,dy\) in Cartesian coordinates, in polar coordinates we have $$\boxed{dA=\red{r}\,dr\,d\theta}$$
      <b>So, never forget to write this factor \(\red{r}\)!</b> (It's called the Jacobian for the change from cartesian coordinates to polar coordinates...)

      <br><br>So, if we have the polar region
      $$D=\{(r,\theta)\mid \alpha\leq\theta\leq\beta,~ h_1(\theta)\leq r\leq h_2(\theta)\}$$
      Then the integral can be written as
      $$\boxed{\iint_Df(x,y)dA=\int_\alpha^\beta\int_{h_1(\theta)}^{h_2(\theta)}f(r\cos\theta,r\sin\theta)\,r\,dr\,d\theta}$$
      (Notice that \(f(r\cos\theta,r\sin\theta)\) just means: \(f(x,y)\), but written in polar coordinates.)

      <h1>Summary of triple integrals in Cartesian coordinates</h1>
      Cartesian coordinates are "normal" coordinates, i.e., \((x,y,z)\). Sometimes you need to integrate over a 3D region which is expressed in Cartesian coordinates. This is actually very similar to doing double integrals in Cartesian coordinates, except we now have three integrals instead of two.

      <br><br> For Cartesian coordinates, we have $$dV=dx\,dy\,dz$$
      You can even put the \(dx\), \(dy\) and \(dz\) in any order that you like (or need). So nothing special is going on here.

      <h1>Summary of cylindrical coordinates</h1>
      The cylindrical coordinate system is a coordinate system to describe points \((r,\theta,z)\) in 3D. Here \(r\) and \(\theta\) are the polar coordinates of the projection of the point onto the \(xy\)-plane, and \(z\) is the height of the point.
      <br><image src="cylindrical.png" width=300px/><br>
      
      Since cylindrical coordinates are just "polar coordinates with a height", there is nothing fundamentally new; for cylindrical coordinates we have:
      $$\boxed{x=r\cos\theta \qquad y=r\sin\theta \qquad z=z}$$
      $$\boxed{x^2+y^2=r^2}$$

      And whereas we have \(dV=dx\,dy\,dz\) in Cartesian coordinates, in cylindrical coordinates we have $$\boxed{dV=\red{r}\,dz\,dr\,d\theta}$$
      You see? It's the same \(\red r\) as for normal polar coordinates (where \(dA=\red r\,dr\,d\theta\)).

      <br><br>So, if we have the region in cylindrical coordinates, then the integral can be written as (with the appropriate bounds, of course)
      $$\boxed{\iiint_Ef(x,y,z)dV=\int_{\dots}^{\dots}\int_{\dots}^{\dots}\int_{\dots}^{\dots}f^*(r,\theta,z)\,r\,dz\,dr\,d\theta}$$
      where \(f^*(r,\theta,z)\) just means: \(f(x,y,z)\), but written in cylindrical coordinates.

      <h1>Summary of spherical coordinates</h1>
      The spherical coordinate system is a coordinate system to describe points \((\rho,\theta,\phi)\) in 3D using \(\rho\), the radial distance, \(\theta\), the azimuthal angle, and \(\phi\), the polar angle, as in the sketch:
      <br><image src="spherical.png" width=300px/><br>
      So here, \(\theta\) is the angle in the \(xy\)-plane measured from the \(x\)-axis to the \(y\)-axis, and \(\phi\) is the angle "down" from the \(z\)-axis.
      
      <!--<br><br>As an example, say that we consider all points for which \(x^2+y^2+z^2\leq25\). These are all points that are at most a radius \(\sqrt{25}=5\) away from the origin, so we have \(0\leq\rho\leq5\). Furthermore, \(\theta\) can run the full circle in the \(xy\)-plane: \(0\leq\theta\leq2\pi\). As for \(\phi\), it has to run from "all the way up" (\(\phi=0\)) to "all the way down" (\(\phi=\pi\)), so \(0\leq\phi\leq\pi\). So the region \(x^2+y^2+z^2\leq25\) can also be written as $$\{(\rho,\theta,\phi) \mid 0\leq\rho\leq5,~ 0\leq\theta\leq2\pi,~ 0\leq\phi\leq\pi\}$$.-->

      Now, these are the fundamental equations that are valid for spherical coordinates:
      $$\boxed{x=\rho\sin\phi\cos\theta \qquad y=\rho\sin\phi\sin\theta \qquad z=\rho\cos\phi}$$
      $$\boxed{x^2+y^2+z^2=\rho^2}$$

      And whereas we have \(dV=dx\,dy\,dz\) in Cartesian coordinates, in spherical coordinates we have $$\boxed{dV=\red{\rho^2\sin\phi}\,d\rho\,d\theta\,d\phi}$$
      <b>So, never forget to write this factor of \(\red{\rho^2\sin\phi}\)! (It's a Jacobian)</b>

      <br><br>So, if we have the region in spherical coordinates
      $$E=\{(\rho,\theta,\phi)\mid a\leq\rho\leq b,~ \alpha\leq\theta\leq\beta,~ c\leq\phi\leq d\}$$
      Then the integral can be written as
      $$\boxed{\iiint_Ef(x,y,z)dV=\int_c^d\int_\alpha^\beta\int_{a}^{b}f^*(\rho,\theta,\phi)\,\rho^2\sin\phi\,d\rho\,d\theta\,d\phi}$$
      where \(f^*(\rho,\theta,\phi)\) just means: \(f(x,y,z)\), but written in spherical coordinates.
      <br><div style=font-size:14px>That is: \(f^*(\rho,\theta,\phi)=f(\rho\sin\phi\cos\theta,~\rho\sin\phi\sin\theta,~\rho\cos\phi)\)</div>
