      <h1>Summary of double integrals in Cartesian coordinates</h1>
      (Cartesian coordinates are just \((x,y)\) in 2D or \((x,y,z)\) in 3D)
      <br><br>
      If you have a rectangular region of integration \(D=\{(x,y)\mid a\leq x\leq b,~ c\leq y\leq d\}\)
      Then: $$\iint_D f(x,y)dA=\int_a^b\int_c^df(x,y)dy\,dx=\int_c^d\int_a^bf(x,y)dx\,dy$$

      <br><br>
      For a <b>Type I</b> region of integration:
      $$D=\{(x,y)\mid a\leq x\leq b,~ g_1(x)\leq y\leq g_2(x)\}$$
      $$\iint_D f(x,y)dA=\int_a^b\int_{g_1(x)}^{g_2(x)}f(x,y)dydx$$

      <br><br>
      For a <b>Type II</b> region of integration:
      $$D=\{(x,y)\mid c\leq y\leq d,~ h_1(y)\leq x\leq h_2(y)\}$$
      $$\iint_D f(x,y)dA=\int_c^d\int_{h_1(y)}^{h_2(y)}f(x,y)dxdy$$

      <b>With double integrals you can calculate the volume of solid bodies. If the question is: "calculate the volume of the solid body that lies between the surface \(z=f(x,y)=\dots\) and the \(xy\)-plane above the region \(D\)", then that volume is calculated by \(\displaystyle\iint_Df(x,y)dA\).</b><br>Sometimes you can solve the integral in Cartesian coordinates and sometimes you have to convert to polar coordinates (see below).<br> (And of course you can do a lot more with double integrals, but the exam usually asks about volumes of bodies...)

      <h1>Summary of double integrals in polar coordinates</h1>
      The polar coordinate system is a coordinate system to describe points \((r,\theta)\) in 2D using \(r\), the radial distance, and \(\theta\), the azimuthal angle.
      <br><image src="polar-crop.png" width=450/><br>
      Here, \(\theta\) is the angle measured from the \(x\)-axis to the \(y\)-axis, so anticlockwise. For example, the point \(P\) in the sketch is the point \((r,\theta)\) with \(r=1\) and \(\theta=\frac{\pi}{3}\).
      
      <br>
      Now, when solving integrals with polar coordinates, it is crucial to remember these identities:
      $$\boxed{x=r\cos\theta \qquad y=r\sin\theta}$$
      $$\boxed{x^2+y^2=r^2}$$

      And whereas we have \(dA=dx\,dy\) in Cartesian coordinates, in polar coordinates we have $$\boxed{dA=\red{r}\,dr\,d\theta}$$
      <b>So, never forget to write this factor \(\red{r}\)!</b> (It's called the Jacobian for the change from cartesian coordinates to polar coordinates...)

      <br><br>So, if we have the polar region
      $$D=\{(r,\theta)\mid \alpha\leq\theta\leq\beta,~ h_1(\theta)\leq r\leq h_2(\theta)\}$$
      Then the integral can be written as
      $$\boxed{\iint_Df(x,y)dA=\int_\alpha^\beta\int_{h_1(\theta)}^{h_2(\theta)}f(r\cos\theta,r\sin\theta)\,\red r\,dr\,d\theta}$$
      (Notice that \(f(r\cos\theta,r\sin\theta)\) just means: \(f(x,y)\), but written in polar coordinates.)

      <h1>Summary of triple integrals in Cartesian coordinates</h1>
      Cartesian coordinates are "normal" coordinates, i.e., \((x,y,z)\). Sometimes you need to integrate over a 3D region which is expressed in Cartesian coordinates. This is actually very similar to doing double integrals in Cartesian coordinates, except we now have three integrals instead of two.

      <br><br> For Cartesian coordinates, we have $$dV=dx\,dy\,dz$$
      You can put the \(dx\), \(dy\) and \(dz\) in any order that you like (or need). So nothing special is going on here.
      An example triple integral (that you would evaluate in Cartesian coordinates) is $$\int_0^3\int_0^{z^2}\int_0^{y-z}(3x-2y)\,dx\,dy\,dz$$
      which would correspond to the region of integration $$E=\{(x,y,z)\mid0\leq z\leq3,~0\leq y\leq z^2,~ 0\leq x\leq y-z\}$$
      Notice that the preferred order of integration can depend on how your region is defined.

      <h1>Summary of triple integrals in cylindrical coordinates</h1>
      The cylindrical coordinate system is a coordinate system to describe points \((r,\theta,z)\) in 3D. Here \(r\) and \(\theta\) are the polar coordinates of the projection of the point onto the \(xy\)-plane, and \(z\) is the height of the point.
      <br><image src="cylindrical.png" width=300px/><br>
      
      Since cylindrical coordinates are just "polar coordinates with a height", there is nothing fundamentally new; for cylindrical coordinates we have:
      $$\boxed{x=r\cos\theta \qquad y=r\sin\theta \qquad z=z}$$
      $$\boxed{x^2+y^2=r^2}$$

      And whereas we have \(dV=dx\,dy\,dz\) in Cartesian coordinates, in cylindrical coordinates we have $$\boxed{dV=\red{r}\,dz\,dr\,d\theta}$$
      You see? It's the same \(\red r\) as for normal polar coordinates (where \(dA=\red r\,dr\,d\theta\)).

      <br><br>So, if we have the region in cylindrical coordinates, then the integral can be written as (with the appropriate bounds, of course)
      $$\boxed{\iiint_Ef(x,y,z)dV=\int_{\dots}^{\dots}\int_{\dots}^{\dots}\int_{\dots}^{\dots}f^*(r,\theta,z)\,r\,dz\,dr\,d\theta}$$
      where \(f^*(r,\theta,z)\) just means: \(f(x,y,z)\), but written in cylindrical coordinates.

      <h1>Summary of triple integrals in spherical coordinates</h1>
      The spherical coordinate system is a coordinate system to describe points \((\rho,\theta,\phi)\) in 3D using \(\rho\), the radial distance, \(\theta\), the azimuthal angle, and \(\phi\), the polar angle, as in the sketch:
      <br><image src="spherical.png" width=300px/><br>
      So here, \(\theta\) is the angle in the \(xy\)-plane measured from the \(x\)-axis to the \(y\)-axis, and \(\phi\) is the angle "down" from the \(z\)-axis.
      
      <!--<br><br>As an example, say that we consider all points for which \(x^2+y^2+z^2\leq25\). These are all points that are at most a radius \(\sqrt{25}=5\) away from the origin, so we have \(0\leq\rho\leq5\). Furthermore, \(\theta\) can run the full circle in the \(xy\)-plane: \(0\leq\theta\leq2\pi\). As for \(\phi\), it has to run from "all the way up" (\(\phi=0\)) to "all the way down" (\(\phi=\pi\)), so \(0\leq\phi\leq\pi\). So the region \(x^2+y^2+z^2\leq25\) can also be written as $$\{(\rho,\theta,\phi) \mid 0\leq\rho\leq5,~ 0\leq\theta\leq2\pi,~ 0\leq\phi\leq\pi\}$$.-->

      Now, these are the fundamental equations that are valid for spherical coordinates:
      $$\boxed{x=\rho\sin\phi\cos\theta \qquad y=\rho\sin\phi\sin\theta \qquad z=\rho\cos\phi}$$
      $$\boxed{x^2+y^2+z^2=\rho^2}$$

      And whereas we have \(dV=dx\,dy\,dz\) in Cartesian coordinates, in spherical coordinates we have $$\boxed{dV=\red{\rho^2\sin\phi}\,d\rho\,d\theta\,d\phi}$$
      <b>So, never forget to write this factor of \(\red{\rho^2\sin\phi}\)! (It's a Jacobian)</b>

      <br><br>So, if we have the region in spherical coordinates
      $$E=\{(\rho,\theta,\phi)\mid a\leq\rho\leq b,~ \alpha\leq\theta\leq\beta,~ c\leq\phi\leq d\}$$
      Then the integral can be written as
      $$\boxed{\iiint_Ef(x,y,z)dV=\int_c^d\int_\alpha^\beta\int_{a}^{b}f^*(\rho,\theta,\phi)\,\rho^2\sin\phi\,d\rho\,d\theta\,d\phi}$$
      where \(f^*(\rho,\theta,\phi)\) just means: \(f(x,y,z)\), but written in spherical coordinates.
      <br><div style=font-size:14px>That is: \(f^*(\rho,\theta,\phi)=f(\rho\sin\phi\cos\theta,~\rho\sin\phi\sin\theta,~\rho\cos\phi)\)</div>
